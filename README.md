Extra Life is an event and charity like no other. I have been participating in Extra Life for over 5 years and
really enjoy being able to provide hope to children in need, especially when all they want to do is feel better
and be kids! If you used this module, or are just feeling generous, [please consider donating to this amazing
cause](https://www.extra-life.org/participant/goyney). Your donations directly benefit Children's Miracle Network
Hospitals and are tax deductable.
